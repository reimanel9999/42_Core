Write a program that will take as argument an integer n followed by a set of integer. 
Your program should display all the subset of s whose sum of elements is n. 
The order of the lines is not important, but the order if the element in  a subset is.
You must not have any duplicates in case of a malloc problem exit 1;

display all subsets of a set whose sum of its elements is equal to the first argument.
The numbers of the set are from the second argument to the last.
A subset must not be displayed a second time.

ex1
./a.out 5 2 3 | cat -e
2 3$

ex2
./a.out 12 5 7 4 3 2 | cat -e
5 7$
5 4 3$
7 3 2$
*/

they do not test invalid sequences such as :

./a.out 5 12 18 | cat -e

the order of the lines is not important, but the order of the input is.

this is valid

./a.out 5 3 2 1 4 | cat -e 
3 2$
1 4$

this is valid

./a.out 5 3 2 1 4 | cat -e 
1 4$
3 2$

ceci n'est pas valide

./a.out 5 3 2 1 4 | cat -e 
4 1$
2 3$

be careful if the number to be reached is 0 because ‘nothing’ is considered a possibility, so a new line will have to be displayed.

./a.out 0 1 -1 2 -2 | cat -e
$
-1 1 2 -2$
-1 1$
2 -2$
